PACSTUDENT ------ THE PACMAN REMAKE ----- CATS VS BIRD

Hello!

This is my repository for the game development assignment remaking the original pacman game.

Pacstudent offers 2 levels:

  Level 1: similar to the original pacman but redesigned - cats chase the bird
  Level 2: additional elements make the game more challenging

    - Traps: 4 birdcages have been placed on the map. If Pacstudent enters them it cannot move for 4 seconds. Ghosts can eat the Pacstudent during this time.
            (Cats eat the bird in the birdcage).
    - Bonus Cherry: The spawning star received additional functionality protecting the Pacstudent from collisions with the Ghosts. 
                    It has a particle effect to show how long it is active.
    - Additional Ghosts (Cats): To make the game even more challenging every 20 seconds a new ghost appears.

Ideas to further adjust the game and make it more challenging:
  - adjust the interval times: hold pacstudent longer in the birdcage trap, shorten the bonus cherry protection effect, make the additional ghosts appear earlier
  - don't destroy the birdcage gameobjects after pacstudent collided
  - change pacstudent and/or ghosts moving speed

I hope you like the game!
